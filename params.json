This App makes it possible to talk like Rick in *Rick and Morty*.\r\n\r\nSupport me: <a href=\"https://flattr.com/submit/auto?fid=o6wo7q&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fno-go%2FRickApp\" target=\"_blank\">![Flattr This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/RickApp/master/flattr.png)</a>\r\n\r\n[APK File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/RickApp/master/app/app-release.apk) or get the App from [f-Droid](http://f-droid.org)\r\n\r\n## App Icon\r\n\r\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/RickApp/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Threshold ruler: modify the noise limit\r\n- RickApp plays a burp sound, if there is a realy short time without noise\r\n- It plays a new burp only after 2 seconds to protect from endless burps\r\n- If your mobile plays sound, RickApp *hears* it, too.\r\n- RickApp shows the sound sampling values in a textbox\r\n\r\nYour Screen is off, but RickApp does not sleep! Use the *recent App* feature of your Homescreen and close RickApp by swiping it away.\r\n\r\n    This App uses the microphone! You can not use the microphone, if you get a call and RickApp works!\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/RickApp/master/screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nI publish everything under the free BSD-2 License.\r\n",
